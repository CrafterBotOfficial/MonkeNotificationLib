# MonkeNotificationLib
A simple plugin for the game Gorilla Tag that allows mods to quickly show the player information in a console-style UI.

## Documentation
There are only two public methods in the entire mod, making it very easy to use. To append a message simply call ``UnityEngine.UI.Text line = NotificationController.AppendMessage("Message Source", "message content");``. This will pull a line from the object pool and display it to the user. Note if the object pool runs out it will create a new line, however it would be inefficent and lag the game.
Needs custom colors? There is also a extension method for quickly wrapping your string in color. Note there are a couple colors that will be overriden for my own colors, check the source code. ``"My string".WrapColor("red")``
